
Issue 1: We are expecting all token (except string , char literals, comments) to be separated by whitespace ' '
	     We need to start supporting token creation without whitespace between to tokens

Issue 2:		/
					  TODO Issue Add Separator Token in case if it combined
					  with keywork or identifier.
					  
					  Example :
					  
					  Keyword value:public
					  
					  Keyword value:static
					  
					  Keyword value:void
					  
					  Separator value:(
					  
					  Identifier value:main
					  
					  Identifier value:String
					  
					  Separator value:. Separator value:.
					  
					  Separator value:.
					  
					  Separator value:)

Enhancement 1: SEPARATORS_PERIOD_TOKEN Support in case of Math.
 
Enhancement 2:  Currently Lexical analyse does not support "longest token rule"
         		i.e. it includes characters in a token until it reaches a character
         		that cannot be included.
